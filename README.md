**Worksheet Generator**

This is a flask web app that allows a user to generate a few different types of maths worksheets/quizzes.

I started this project to help me create resources for my students as an online tutor. 
Instead of having to write out trivial repetetive questions such as times tables for my students' to answer, I developed this simple website to randomly generate worksheets as webpages for me.
I can then print the webpages to pdfs in just a few seconds when prepping for a lesson.
