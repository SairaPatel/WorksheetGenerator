**Worksheet Generator**

This is a simple flask web app that allows a user to generate a few different types of maths worksheets/quizzes.

I started this project to help me create resources for my students as an online tutor. 
Instead of having to write out trivial repetitive questions for my students' to answer, I developed this simple website to randomly generate worksheets as webpages.
I can then print the webpages to pdfs in just a few seconds when prepping for a lesson.
