# Maths Resource Generator

This is a simple flask web app that allows a user to generate a few different types of maths worksheets/quizzes.


## Project Origin/Goal ##
I started this project to help me create resources for my students as an online tutor. 
Instead of having to write out trivial repetitive questions for my students' to answer, I developed this simple website to randomly generate worksheets as webpages.
I can then print the webpages to pdfs in just a few seconds when prepping for a lesson. 

The site can generate 4 different types of resources.
- A basic multiplication worksheet for learning times tables
- A basic division worksheet for learning times tables
- An indices worksheet for learning powers/roots of numbers
- A quiz for formulae that needs to be memorised for GCSE Maths 

Each resource is customisable with different types and numbers of questions. 

## Previews ## 
These are the form pages for each resource type:

## Eval ## 
This project had minimal complexity but is perfectly effective for my initial goal/vision. The interface is not too convoluted but there is still the ability customise resources as much as needed with minimal effort/input. The worksheet generation is randomised and straightforward. No database was required due to the mathmatical nature of the resources. 
In future, I could see myself extending this project beyond non-mathmatical resources, perhaps allowing a simiiar automated generation of worksheets/quizes using a database of pre-entered content.
